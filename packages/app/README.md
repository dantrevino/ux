# The Blockstack App

</div>

The Blockstack App is an application for interacting and authenticating with [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org) apps. It can be used as a hosted web app (available at [app.blockstack.org](https://app.blockstack.org)) or as a browser extension.

To use this application with your own Blockstack App, we recommend using [Blockstack Connect](https://github.com/blockstack/connect).

## Development

Although this app is usable as a browser extension, the best interface for development is as a normal web app. This is because it's faster and easier to develop it as a web app, for reasons like hot module loading, and not having to deal with the browser extensions UI constantly.
